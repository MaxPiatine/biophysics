## Abstract
Understanding the dynamics of ion flux and polarization in spatially polarized excitable cells is crucial for fundamental physiological processes such as
wound healing, muscle contraction, and nerve impulse transmission. This study investigates a charge difference model as a two-compartmentalized cell
connected by a gap junction. Through theoretical analyses and simulations, we explore the result of symmetry breaking by manipulating ion permeability ratios
and elongating the cell on endogenous electric fields. Our findings reveal that symmetry breaking can significantly enhance endogenous electric field strength
while staying within realistic constraints. Our results provide valuable insights into cellular polarization mechanisms and offer implications
for future research in cell physiology.
